# JY_FLOAT

This header file is "forked" from http://half.sourceforge.net/. I modified it to make a simulator for deep learning framework.

This DO NOT follow IEEE 754-based floating point library. Actually at first, I just considered use it only myself.
So if you want to use it, please be very careful!!!!

Actually we call this new standard JY floating point standard. The reason why I choose this name is because
my friend JY always go to a barber's shop named "A FLOAT". However, recently, he told me that his barber leave
"A FLOAT". It's a really disappointing news. I may consider rename this standard.
